R2\u2019s source work is the most rigorous: it cites exact \u1e25adith books/numbers, flags a weak narration (Tirmidh\u012b 1579) as \u201cDaif\u201d, and distinguishes between text and commentary.  R1 provides only vague attributions: \u201cAs-Silsilah As-Saheehah\u201d with no number, and a lengthy story of F\u0101\u1e6dimah and Asm\u0101\u2019 that is historical but has disputed chains; no grading or source details are supplied.

The lone hadith \u201cDo not judge people by their appearances, but judge them by their actions\u201d is not found in Sahih al-Bukhari; it appears to be a paraphrase or apocryphal statement, so the attribution is incorrect.

R2\u2019s Qur\u2019an excerpts are accurate, but it cites the hadith on loss of knowledge to \u2018Ibn M\u0101jah\u2019; in fact the sound version is in al-Bukh\u0101r\u012b (\u1e25ad\u012bth no.100) and Muslim. Minor unsourced anecdotes (Ibn \u02bfUmar \u21c4 Ab\u016b Hurayrah) are presented as fact.
